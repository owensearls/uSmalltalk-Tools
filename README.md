# uSmalltalk-Tools
A set of tools for working with Micro-Smalltalk files in Sublime Text

## Usage
This package can be installed by cloning the repository directly into your
Sublime Text "Packages" directory. All files using the .smt extension should
then automatically be displayed using the uSmalltalk syntax, and can be built
automatically using the usmalltalk binary on the Tufts CS server.

## Attribution
This package provides tools for working with the uSmalltalk language written
by Norman Ramsey. The syntax highlighting is loosely based on the
Lisp.sublime-syntax provided with Sublime Text 3.
